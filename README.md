# Learning Resources
Unlike other languages, we cannot learn Rust by directly jump into coding. 
This is the first con about the Rust language.
We need to understand few important concepts of Rust, before we start writing some code samples. Otherwise understanding the code snippets from code samples would quickly become frustating and boring. 
Few important resourses to start with:
* **The Rust Programming Language**
* **Rust By Example**
* **Rustlings**: The command line version of Rust Guide

# Tools required
* **RustUP**
* **Cargo**

All you need to do is run the following command in any Nix OS

> ```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh```
